# 1020-project

This is a project which was created for the class "ENGI 1020 - Introduction to programming" by Thomas Porter and Ethan Smith. It is a password manager which uses a Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino. 

Generally, the console on the computer running the code is used for inputting user information, and the kit is used to sign in and view the information. Sensitive user information such as passwords are encrypted using Fernet, where the hash key is stored in a .env file. The sign in information for the email functionality is stored in the .env file as well.
